# AI Learning Projects

Learning AI/Deep Learning fundamentals through hands-on projects.

## Current Focus
- Deep Learning Course (Andrew Ng) + practical implementations
- Python, NumPy and building things from scratch
- Goal: AI/ML role by December 2025

## Approach
- Theory + immediate coding practice
- Build unique projects, not tutorial copies
- Document what I learn along the way

## Projects
Each folder contains a project with what I built and what I learned.
